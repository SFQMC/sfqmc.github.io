-------------------------

The trial wavefunction in AFQMC is typically a linear combination of Slater determinants,

.. math::
  |\Psi_\mathrm{T} \rangle = \sum^{N_\mathrm{det}}_n C_n | \Phi_n \rangle

where :math:`C_n` is a complex-valued coefficient, and :math:`|\Phi_n\rangle` are Slater determinants which are not necessarily orthogonal to each other. Of course, each Slater determinant consists of some set of single-particle orbitals, :math:`\{ \psi_p \}`, such that,

.. math::
  \psi_{p} = \sum_i \bar{C}_{ip} \phi_i

where :math:`\{\phi_i\}` are the chosen orthonormal basis set orbitals. Slater determinants can either be represented explicitly as a Slater matrix,

.. math::
  \Phi = \begin{bmatrix}
    \bar{C}_{00} &\bar{C}_{01} & \bar{C}_{02} & \dots  & \bar{C}_{0N} \\
    \bar{C}_{10} & \bar{C}_{11} & \bar{C}_{12} & \dots  & \bar{C}_{1N} \\
    \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
    \bar{C}_{M0} & \bar{C}_{M1} & \bar{C}_{M2} & \dots  & \bar{C}_{MN}
  \end{bmatrix}

where :math:`M,N` are the number of basis functions and electrons, respectively, or in terms of an "occupation vector", which is simply a list of orbital indices which should be occupied.
See the :ref:`SAFIRE tutorials <tutorials>` for tutorials and examples on generating and writing trial wavefunctions.

SAFIRE implements two basic types of trial wavefunction:

1. **"particle-hole" multi-Slater determinant (ph-mSD) trial wavefunctions** which is a configuration interaction-like wavefunction where :math:`\langle \Phi_n |\Phi_m\rangle = \delta_{nm} \forall n,m`.
   In this case, the Slater determinants are specified in terms of a set of orbitals, and a list of :math:`C_n` and corresponding occupancy vectors. See the HDF5 file format description in :ref:`PHMSD <phmsd_wavefunction>` for more.

2. **non-orthogonal multi-slater Determinant (NOMSD) trial wavefunction** where *strictly* :math:`\langle \Phi_n |\Phi_m\rangle \neq 0 \forall n,m`. In this case, the Slater determinants are specified as a list of :math:`C_n` and corresponding Slater matrices. See the HDF5 file format description in :ref:`NOMSD <nomsd_wavefunction>` for more.

We'll explore each of these wavefunction types in more detail below.

.. note::
   Using the ph-mSD trial wavefunction is recommended when using a large number of determinants since it is significantly more memory efficient than the NOMSD trial wavefunction,
   and since, in some cases, fast Woodbury updates can be applied.

.. warning::
  When using NOMSD trial wavefunctions, it is important that each Slater determinant has a non-zero overlap with all other Slater determinants to avoid singular values. Use ph-mSD for orthogonal expansions of Slater determinants.

AFQMC allows for two types of multi-determinant trial wavefunctions: non-orthogonal multi
Slater determinants (NOMSD) or SHCI/CASSCF style particle-hole multi Slater determinants
(PHMSD).

Both carry a ``format_version`` integer attribute on ``/Wavefunction/NOMSD`` or
``/Wavefunction/PHMSD``, which SAFIRE checks against the version it reads; a file without one,
or with another version, is rejected and has to be regenerated. The one exception is the legacy
layout CoQuí writes, recognized by a ``dims`` array in place of ``format_version`` and
``spin_type``, which is still read.


.. _nomsd_wavefunction:

.. code-block:: text

    h5dump -n wfn.h5

    HDF5 "wfn.h5" {
        FILE_CONTENTS {
            group      /
            group      /Wavefunction
            group      /Wavefunction/NOMSD
            group      /Wavefunction/NOMSD/PsiT_0
            dataset    /Wavefunction/NOMSD/PsiT_0/column_indices
            dataset    /Wavefunction/NOMSD/PsiT_0/row_pointers
            dataset    /Wavefunction/NOMSD/PsiT_0/shape
            dataset    /Wavefunction/NOMSD/PsiT_0/values
            group      /Wavefunction/NOMSD/PsiT_1
            dataset    /Wavefunction/NOMSD/PsiT_1/column_indices
            dataset    /Wavefunction/NOMSD/PsiT_1/row_pointers
            dataset    /Wavefunction/NOMSD/PsiT_1/shape
            dataset    /Wavefunction/NOMSD/PsiT_1/values
            dataset    /Wavefunction/NOMSD/ci_coeffs
        }
    }

Note that the :math:`\alpha` components of the trial wavefunction are stored under
``PsiT_{2n}`` and the :math:`\beta` components are stored under ``PsiT_{2n+1}``.

-  ``/Wavefunction/NOMSD/PsiT_{2n}`` The :math:`n`-th :math:`\alpha` Slater matrix as a CSR
   matrix. Note the **conjugate transpose** of the Slater matrix is stored, so it has
   :math:`N_\alpha` rows and :math:`N_p M` columns (:math:`N_p = 2` for noncollinear
   wavefunctions, 1 otherwise). Its datasets are

   -  ``shape``: :math:`[N_\alpha, N_p M]`.
   -  ``values``: the :math:`nnz` non-zero elements.
   -  ``column_indices``: the column index of each non-zero element.
   -  ``row_pointers``: :math:`N_\alpha + 1` offsets; row :math:`i` holds entries
      ``row_pointers[i]`` up to (not including) ``row_pointers[i+1]`` of ``values`` and
      ``column_indices``.

   The legacy layout CoQuí writes (``dims``, ``data_``, ``jdata_``, ``pointers_begin_``,
   ``pointers_end_``) is read as well.
-  ``/Wavefunction/NOMSD/ci_coeffs`` :math:`N_D` length array of ci coefficients. Stored
   as complex numbers.
-  ``spin_type`` attribute of ``/Wavefunction/NOMSD``: ``"closed"``, ``"collinear"`` or
   ``"noncollinear"``.

No sizes are stored separately. :math:`N_D` is the length of ``ci_coeffs``, :math:`M` and
:math:`N_\alpha` are the columns and rows of ``PsiT_0``, and :math:`N_\beta` the rows of
``PsiT_1``.


.. _phmsd_wavefunction:

PHMSD
~~~~~

.. code-block:: text

    h5dump -n wfn.h5

    HDF5 "wfn.h5" {
        FILE_CONTENTS {
            group      /
            group      /Wavefunction
            group      /Wavefunction/PHMSD
            dataset    /Wavefunction/PHMSD/ci_coeffs
            dataset    /Wavefunction/PHMSD/occa
            dataset    /Wavefunction/PHMSD/occb
        }
    }

-  ``/Wavefunction/PHMSD/ci_coeffs`` :math:`N_D` length array of ci coefficients. Stored
   as complex numbers.
-  ``spin_type`` attribute of ``/Wavefunction/PHMSD``: ``"collinear"``.
-  ``number_of_orbitals`` attribute of ``/Wavefunction/PHMSD``: the number of spatial
   orbitals :math:`M`.
-  ``/Wavefunction/PHMSD/occa``, ``/Wavefunction/PHMSD/occb`` Integer arrays of shape
   :math:`[N_D,N_\alpha]` and :math:`[N_D,N_\beta]` describing the determinant occupancies.
   For example if :math:`(N_\alpha=N_\beta=2)`, :math:`N_D=2`, :math:`M=4`, and
   :math:`|\Psi_\mathrm{T}\rangle = |0,1\rangle|0,1\rangle + |0,1\rangle|0,2\rangle` then
   occa = :math:`[[0, 1], [0, 1]]` and occb = :math:`[[0, 1], [0, 2]]`.
-  ``/Wavefunction/PHMSD/PsiT_0``, ``/Wavefunction/PHMSD/PsiT_1`` (optional) Orbital
   references, if the occupancies refer to a different basis than the one the integrals are
   written in. Each is the matrix of reference orbitals in the integrals' basis, stored as the
   CSR matrix of its conjugate transpose, so it has one row per reference orbital and
   :math:`N_p M` columns (the same datasets as a NOMSD ``PsiT``). There is either one, ``PsiT_0``, shared by both spins, or
   ``PsiT_0`` (:math:`\alpha`) and ``PsiT_1`` (:math:`\beta`) for a spin-resolved reference.
   Without any, the occupancies refer to the integrals' basis.

:math:`N_D` is the length of ``ci_coeffs``, :math:`N_\alpha` and :math:`N_\beta` the widths of
``occa`` and ``occb``, and the number of orbital references the number of ``PsiT_<n>`` groups.
:math:`M` is the one size that is stored explicitly, since the occupancies alone do not span the
orbitals.


.. _initial_walkers:

Initial walkers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A trial wavefunction file does not store an initial walker. Every walker of a walker set starts
out as a determinant derived from a wavefunction instead: the determinant with the largest
coefficient of a NOMSD wavefunction, or the reference determinant of a PHMSD one. By default
that is the wavefunction of the execute block that introduces the walker set; the ``from``
parameter of the walker set names a different one, either by name or as an inline block:

.. code-block:: json

    {
      "wavefunctions": [
        {"name": "uhf", "filename": "wfn_uhf.h5"},
        {"name": "rohf", "filename": "wfn_rohf.h5"}
      ],
      "execute": [
        {
          "wavefunction": "uhf",
          "walker_set": {"from": {"wavefunction": "rohf"}},
          "num_walkers": 200
        }
      ]
    }

Starting from an ROHF determinant rather than the UHF trial itself can speed up equilibration
considerably. Only the first execute block falls back to a default walker set; a later execute
block without a ``walker_set`` continues with the walker set of the one before it.
