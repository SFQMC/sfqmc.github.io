.. _Hamiltonian-classes:


Hamiltonian File formats
------------------------

The Hamiltonian is, of course, one of the key inputs to SAFIRE.
SAFIRE is aware only of the generic class of Hamiltonian, so that it can take advantage of 
class-specific algorithms while remaining general.
Python-based tools to generate Hamiltonians, among other inputs, are provided in the `afqmctools` module.
See the afqmctools documentation :ref:`afqmctools` and the tutorials :ref:`tutorials` for more details.

Several generic classes of Hamiltonians are implemented and described in detail below.

#. :ref:`Dense Cholesky <dense-cholesky>`
#. :ref:`K-Point Factorized (KP) <k_point_factorized>`
#. :ref:`Lattice Model Hamiltonian <lattice_model_hamiltonian>`
#. :ref:`THC Hamiltonian <thc_hamiltonian>`

Every format below carries a ``format_version`` integer attribute on ``/Hamiltonian``, which
SAFIRE checks against the version it reads; a file without one, or with another version, is
rejected and has to be regenerated. CoQuí files have no ``/Hamiltonian`` group and are exempt.

.. _dense-cholesky:

Dense Cholesky
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A common Hamiltonian type that is implemented in SAFIRE is based on the modified-Cholesky
factorization :cite:`BeebeCholesky1977,KochCholesky2003,AquilanteMOLCAS2009,PurwantoCa2011,PurwantoDownfolding2013` of the ERI
tensor:

.. math::
  :label: eq-dense-chol

  v_{pqrs} = V_{(pr),(sq)} \approx \sum_n^{N_{\mathrm{chol}}} L_{pr,n} L^{*}_{sq,n},

where the sum is truncated at :math:`N_{\mathrm{chol}} = x_c M`,
:math:`x_c` is typically between :math:`5` and :math:`10`, :math:`M` is
the number of basis functions and we have assumed that the
single-particle orbitals are in general complex. The storage requirement
is thus naively :math:`\mathcal{O}(M^3)`. Note we follow the usual
definition of :math:`v_{pqrs} = \langle pq | rs \rangle = (pr|qs)`. With
this form of factorization, SAFIRE allows for the integrals to be stored
in either dense or sparse format.

The dense case is the simplest and is only implemented for Hamiltonians
with *real* integrals (and basis functions, i.e. not the homogeneous
electron gas which has complex orbitals but real integrals). The file
format is given as follows:

.. code-block:: text
  :caption: Sample Dense Cholesky AFQMC Hamiltonian.
  :name: Listing_Dense_Cholesky

  $ h5dump -n afqmc.h5
  HDF5 "afqmc.h5" {
      FILE_CONTENTS {
          group      /
          group      /Hamiltonian
          dataset    /Hamiltonian/hcore
          group      /Hamiltonian/DenseFactorized
          dataset    /Hamiltonian/DenseFactorized/L
      }
  }

The number of basis functions :math:`M` and of Cholesky vectors :math:`N_\mathrm{chol}` are read
from the shapes of ``hcore`` and ``L``. The Hamiltonian records no electron count; it is taken
from the trial wavefunction.

**Required datasets:**

-  ``/Hamiltonian/hcore`` One-body Hamiltonian matrix elements :math:`h^{s}_{\sigma p,\tau r}`, with dimensions :math:`[N_s, N_p, M, N_p, M]`. :math:`N_s = 2` for collinear systems (spin up first) and 1 otherwise, and :math:`N_p = 2` for noncollinear systems and 1 otherwise. For **complex integrals**, an additional dimension of size 2 is added to store real and imaginary parts separately.

-  ``/Hamiltonian/DenseFactorized/L`` The Cholesky decomposition tensor :math:`L^{s,n}_{\sigma p,\tau r}`, with dimensions :math:`[N_s, N_p, M, N_p, M, N_\mathrm{chol}]`. :math:`N_s` is either 1, for vectors shared by every spin sector, or that of ``hcore``, for one set per spin sector. Only :math:`N_p = 1` is supported, including for noncollinear systems, whose Cholesky vectors are spin independent.

**Storage conventions:**

- The Dense Cholesky format only supports real-valued Cholesky vectors.
- Complex one-body Hamiltonians should be stored with an additional dimension of size 2, where ``array[..., 0]`` contains real parts and ``array[..., 1]`` contains imaginary parts.
- All arrays are stored in row-major order, the last index running fastest.

.. _k_point_factorized:

K-Point Factorized (KP)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We have implemented an explicitly :math:`k`-point dependent factorization for periodic systems :cite:`MottaKPoint2019,MaloneGPU2020`

.. math::
  :label: eq62

  (\textbf{k}_p p \textbf{k}_r r| \textbf{k}_q q \textbf{k}_s s) = \sum_n L^{\textbf{Q},\textbf{k}}_{pr,n} {L^{\textbf{Q},\textbf{k}'}_{sq,n}}^{*}

where :math:`\textbf{k}`, :math:`\textbf{k}'` and :math:`\textbf{Q}` are
vectors in the first Brillouin zone. The one-body Hamiltonian is block
diagonal in :math:`\textbf{k}` and in :eq:`eq62` we have used
momentum conservation
:math:`(\textbf{k}_p - \textbf{k}_r + \textbf{k}_q - \textbf{k}_s) = \textbf{G}`
with :math:`\textbf{G}` being some vector in the reciprocal lattice of
the simulation cell. The convention for the Cholesky matrix
:math:`L^{\textbf{Q},\textbf{k}}_{pr,\gamma}` is as follows:
:math:`\textbf{k}_r = \textbf{k}_p - \textbf{Q}`, so the vector
:math:`\textbf{k}` labels the *k*-point of the first band index,
:math:`\textit{p}`, while the *k*-point vector of the second band index,
:math:`\textit{r}`, is given by :math:`\textbf{k} - \textbf{Q}`.
Electron repulsion integrals at different :math:`\textbf{Q}` vectors are
zero by symmetry, resulting in a reduction in the number of required
:math:`\mathbf{Q}` vectors. For certain :math:`\textbf{Q}` vectors that
satisfy :math:`\textbf{Q} \ne -\textbf{Q}` (this is not satisfied at the
origin and at high symmetry points on the edge of the 1BZ), we have
:math:`{L^{\textbf{Q},\textbf{k}}_{sq,\gamma}}^{*} = {L^{-\textbf{Q},\textbf{k}-\textbf{Q}}_{qs,\gamma}}`,
which requires us to store Cholesky vectors for either one of the
:math:`(\textbf{Q},-\textbf{Q})` pair, but not both.

In what follows let :math:`m` denote the number of basis functions per
:math:`k`-point, which has to be the same at every :math:`k`-point,
:math:`N_k` the number of :math:`k`-points and
:math:`n_{\mathrm{chol}}^{\mathbf{Q}_n}` the number of Cholesky vectors
for momentum transfer :math:`\mathbf{Q}_n`. The one-body Hamiltonian and
the Cholesky vectors take the layouts of the
:ref:`Dense Cholesky <dense-cholesky>` format with a leading
:math:`k`-point axis; the format holds only spin-independent
Hamiltonians, so :math:`N_s = N_p = 1` throughout. The file format for this
factorization is as follows (for a :math:`2\times2\times2`
:math:`k`-point mesh, for denser meshes generally there will be far
fewer symmetry inequivalent momentum transfer vectors than there are
:math:`k`-points):

          dataset    /Hamiltonian/hcore
      }
  }

-  ``/Hamiltonian/hcore`` One-body Hamiltonian matrix elements
   :math:`h_{(\mathbf{k}p)(\mathbf{k}r)}`, with dimensions :math:`[N_k, 1, 1, m, 1, m]`.

-  ``/Hamiltonian/KPFactorized/L[n]`` This series of datasets store elements of the Cholesky tensors
   :math:`L[\mathbf{Q}_n,\mathbf{k},pr,n]`, each with dimensions
   :math:`[N_k, 1, 1, m, 1, m, n^{\mathbf{Q}_n}_\mathrm{chol}]`, where :math:`\mathbf{k}` is the
   :math:`k`-point of basis function :math:`p`; that of basis function :math:`r` is given by the
   mapping ``QKTok2``. Only one of each :math:`(\mathbf{Q}, -\mathbf{Q})` pair, the one with
   :math:`n \le` ``MinusK[n]``, has to be stored. The normalization :math:`1/\sqrt{N_k}` is
   included.

-  ``/Hamiltonian/MinusK``: :math:`N_k` length array mapping a
   :math:`k`-point to its inverse: :math:`\mathbf{k}_i+`\ ``MinusK[i]``
   :math:`= \mathbf{0} \mod \mathbf{G}`.

-  ``/Hamiltonian/QKTok2``: :math:`[N_k,N_k]` dimensional array.
   ``QKtok2[i,j]`` yields the :math:`k` point index satisfying
   :math:`\mathbf{k}=\mathbf{Q}_i-\mathbf{k}_j+\mathbf{G}`.

-  ``/Hamiltonian/KPoints`` :math:`[N_k,3]` Dimensional array containing :math:`k`-points used to
   sample Brillouin zone.

No sizes are stored separately: :math:`N_k` and :math:`m` are read off ``hcore``, and
:math:`n^{\mathbf{Q}_n}_\mathrm{chol}` off ``L[n]``. The total number of basis functions is
:math:`M = N_k m`. The electron count is taken from the trial wavefunction, and so is the
:math:`N_e` in the electron self-interaction :math:`-N_e \times` ``madelung_constant``, an optional
attribute of ``/Hamiltonian`` named as in CoQuí files.

Complex integrals should be written as an array with an additional dimension, e.g., a 1D array should be written as a 2D array with ``array_hdf5[:,0]=real(1d_array)`` and ``array_hdf5[:,1]=imag(1d_array)``. The functions ``afqmctools.utils.misc.from_complex`` and ``afqmctools.utils.misc.to_complex`` can be used to transform from the internal complex format to complex valued numpy arrays of the appropriate shape and vice versa.

.. _lattice_model_hamiltonian:

Lattice Model Hamiltonian
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

General multi-band, Hubbard-Kanamori (HK) lattice model Hamiltonians are implemented.
The HK Hamiltonian has the general form,

.. math::

   \hat{H} = \sum_{ij,\sigma \sigma'}t^{\sigma \sigma'}_{ij}\hat{c}^\dagger_{i\sigma}\hat{c}_{j\sigma'} 
   + \sum_{i} U_i \hat{n}_{i\uparrow} \hat{n}_{i\downarrow} \\
   + \sum_{i<j} U_{ij}^1 (\hat{n}_{i\uparrow} \hat{n}_{j\downarrow} + \hat{n}_{i\downarrow} \hat{n}_{j\uparrow} ) 
   + \sum_{i<j} U_{ij}^2 (\hat{n}_{i\uparrow} \hat{n}_{j\uparrow} + \hat{n}_{i\downarrow} \hat{n}_{j\downarrow} ) \\
   + \sum_{i<j} J_{ij} ( 
     \hat{c}^\dagger_{i\uparrow}\hat{c}^\dagger_{j\downarrow}\hat{c}_{i\downarrow}\hat{c}_{j\uparrow}
     +\hat{c}^\dagger_{i\uparrow}\hat{c}^\dagger_{i\downarrow}\hat{c}_{j\downarrow}\hat{c}_{j\uparrow} 
     +\hat{c}^\dagger_{j\uparrow}\hat{c}^\dagger_{i\downarrow}\hat{c}_{j\downarrow}\hat{c}_{i\uparrow}
     +\hat{c}^\dagger_{j\uparrow}\hat{c}^\dagger_{j\downarrow}\hat{c}_{i\downarrow}\hat{c}_{i\uparrow} 
     ),

where :math:`i`,\ :math:`j` are combined lattice and band indices,
:math:`\hat{c}^\dagger_{i\sigma}`, :math:`\hat{c}_{j\sigma'}`
create/annihilate and electron on the site (and band) corresponding to
:math:`i`/:math:`j` with spin :math:`\sigma`/:math:`\sigma'`,
:math:`\hat{n}_{i\sigma}` is the number operator,
:math:`t^{\sigma \sigma'}_{ij}` includes all one-body terms
(:math:`n^{th}`-order neighbor hopping, spin-orbit coupling, etc.),
:math:`U` is the traditional on-site hubbard interaction, :math:`U^1` is
a density-density interaction, :math:`U^2` is
a spin-spin interaction, and :math:`J` is a Hund's coupling term.
:math:`U^1`, :math:`U^2`, and :math:`J` are typically only non-zero between
bands on the same lattice site, but are by no means limited in this way.

Each individual term is optional (including the hopping term); 
however, including at least one interaction term is required.

``h5dump -n`` lists no attributes; the ones a model Hamiltonian carries are described below.
For a lattice model the energy attributes are generally left out, i.e. 0.

-  ``number_of_sites`` and ``number_of_bands`` attributes of ``/Hamiltonian/ModelHamiltonian``:
   integers giving the number of lattice sites and of bands per site. The number of basis
   functions is :math:`M = n_\mathrm{sites} n_\mathrm{bands}`. The electron count is taken from
   the trial wavefunction.

-  ``spin_type`` attribute of ``/Hamiltonian``: a string containing the spin symmetry type of the
   Hamiltonian. Possible values are "collinear", or "noncollinear".

-  ``/Hamiltonian/ModelHamiltonian/ModelComponent_n``: (where :math:`n` are replaced by a specific integer index)
   are HDF5 groups, numbered from 0 without gaps; the number of components is where the numbering
   stops. Each contains a Hamiltonian component (i.e. a term), which consists of some metadata
   and a compressed sparse row (CSR) matrix representation of that Hamiltonian component. Each group has the
   following attributes and groups.

    -  ``spin_type`` attribute: a string containing the spin symmetry type of the component.
       Possible values are "collinear", or "noncollinear".

    -  ``model_type`` attribute: a string describing the type of model term.
       Possible values are: "one_body", "hubbard_u", and "hubbard_j".

    -  ``hst_type`` attribute, for "hubbard_u" and "hubbard_j" only: the Hubbard-Stratonovich
       transformation, one of "continuous_charge", "continuous_spin", "discrete_charge" and
       "discrete_spin" (the discrete ones for "hubbard_u" only).

    -  a matrix group. The name of the group depends on ``model_type``.
       Possible values are: ``/tij/`` (``"one_body"``), ``/Uij/`` (``"hubbard_u"``), 
       and ``/Jij/`` (``"hubbard_j"``). Conventions for the shape of each matrix are
       described below. The matrix group will always have the following datasets:
    
      -  ``shape``: :math:`[M_1, M_2]`, the dimensions of the CSR matrix.

      -  ``values``: an array containing the :math:`N_{nz}` non-zero matrix elements.

      -  ``column_indices``: an array containing the column index of each non-zero matrix element.

      -  ``row_pointers``: an array of length :math:`M_1 + 1`; row :math:`i` holds the entries
         ``row_pointers[i]`` up to (not including) ``row_pointers[i+1]`` of ``values`` and
         ``column_indices``, so ``row_pointers[0] = 0`` and ``row_pointers[M_1] = N_{nz}``.

      The reader also accepts the legacy layout CoQuí writes, told apart by the absence of
      ``shape``: ``dims`` (:math:`[M_1, M_2, N_{nz}]`), ``data_``, ``jdata_``, and one
      ``pointers_begin_`` and ``pointers_end_`` offset per row.

Model Component Conventions
___________________________

The following Conventions apply to the CSR matrix representations of each model component.

-  both real- and complex-valued matrices are supported; however, all components must have 
   the same type. i.e. if the hopping matrix is complex-valued, due to a twist, all interaction 
   terms must also be complex-valued even of the imaginary part is identically zero.
  
-  for all interaction terms except for on-site, on-band Hubbard U, we take the convention 
   that :math:`i < j` as shown in the general Hubbard-Kanamori Hamiltonian above. If entries
   with :math:`i >= j` are supplied, they will be ignored with a warning.

-  For ``/tij/``, if :math:`M` is the total basis set size, including bands and sites,
   the CSR matrix may have dimension :math:`M x M`, :math:`2M x M`, or :math:`2M x 2M` 
   corresponding to ``"closed"``, ``"collinear"``, and ``"noncollinear"`` spin symmetry,
   respectively. For a ``"closed"`` hopping matrix, the same hopping will be applied to 
   both spin channels. For a ``"collinear"`` hopping matrix, the upper half of ``/tij/``
   will applied to the spin up channel, and the lower half to the spin-down channel. 
   For a ``"noncollinear"`` hopping matrix, ``/tij/`` is explicitly represented in a 
   spin-orbital basis and is applied as is. We note that ``/tij/`` may contain arbitrary
   one-body terms if desired; for example, a pinning field.

   the CSR matrix may have dimension :math:`M x M`, or :math:`2M x M`. If the dimension
   is :math:`2M x M`, then the upper half of the array is interpreted as :math:`U_{ii}+U1_{ij}`
   with :math:`i,j` running over all basis set functions, and the lower half 
   is interpreted as :math:`U2_{ij}`with :math:`i,j` running over all basis set functions.
   If :math:`U2_{ij}` is desired without :math:`U_{ii}` or :math:`U1_{ij}`, the matrix must
   still have dimension :math:`2M x M`, but the upper half should have no non-zero elements.
   If dimension is :math:`M x M`, then the CSR matrix is interpreted as :math:`U_{ii}+U1_{ij}`.

-  for ``/Jij``, the CSR matrix must have dimension :math:`M x M` and is interpreted as the 
   the :math:`J_{ij}` from the Hubbard-Kanamori term.

The other groups and datasets represent the Hamiltonian "components" (i.e. the terms which
are included in the specific Hamiltonian given to AFQMC).

.. _thc_hamiltonian:

Tensor Hyper Contraction (THC)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Tensor Hyper-Contraction (THC) approach is an efficient method for representing two-electron integrals that exploits the low-rank structure of the electron repulsion integral (ERI) tensor. THC factorizes the four-center electron repulsion integrals into products involving lower-dimensional tensors, providing significant computational savings for AFQMC calculations.

THC represents the ERI tensor as:

.. math::
  :label: eq-thc

  v_{pqrs} \approx \sum_{u}^{N_u} \sum_{v}^{N_v} X_{pu} L_{uv} X_{rv}^*

where :math:`X_{pu}` are collocation matrices that map orbitals to interpolation points, :math:`L_{uv}` is the factorized Coulomb matrix at interpolation points, :math:`N_u` and :math:`N_v` are the numbers of interpolation points, and the approximation quality depends on the choice of interpolation points and the rank of the factorization.

The THC format supports two main variants:

**Option 1: Direct THC factorization**
  Uses the factorized Coulomb matrix :math:`L_{uv}` directly and reuses the same collocation matrix for both electron coordinates.

**Option 2: Half-rotated THC factorization**  
  Uses a half-rotated Coulomb matrix and separate collocation matrices that have been pre-rotated to a specific orbital space.

THC Hamiltonians are stored in HDF5 using the following format:

          dataset    /Interaction/collocation_matrix_half_rotated [Option 2 only]
      }
  }

**Required datasets:**

-  ``/System/H0`` One-body Hamiltonian matrix elements. Dimensions are ``[nspin, nkpts, norb, norb, complex_dim]`` where ``complex_dim=2`` for complex integrals and is omitted for real integrals. For molecular calculations, ``nkpts=1``.

-  ``/Interaction/factorized_coulomb_matrix`` The factorized Coulomb tensor :math:`L_{uv}`. Dimensions are ``[nq, nu, nv, complex_dim]`` where ``nq`` should be 1 for current implementation. For complex integrals, the last dimension has size 2 storing real and imaginary parts.

-  ``/Interaction/collocation_matrix`` The collocation matrix :math:`X_{pu}` mapping orbitals to interpolation points. Dimensions are ``[nspin, nkpts, norb, nu, complex_dim]``.

**Option 1 additional dataset:**

-  ``/Interaction/coulomb_matrix`` The full Coulomb matrix :math:`M_{uv} = L_{uv} \cdot L_{uv}^{\dagger}`. This allows reuse of the same collocation matrix. Dimensions are ``[nq, nu, nu, complex_dim]``.

**Option 2 additional datasets:**

-  ``/Interaction/half_rotated_coulomb_matrix`` A half-rotated version of the Coulomb matrix for specialized THC factorizations. Dimensions are ``[nq, nu_rot, nv_rot, complex_dim]``.

-  ``/Interaction/collocation_matrix_half_rotated`` The corresponding half-rotated collocation matrix. Dimensions match the half-rotated coulomb matrix structure.

**Storage conventions:**

- Complex integrals should be stored with an additional dimension of size 2, where ``array[..., 0]`` contains real parts and ``array[..., 1]`` contains imaginary parts.
- For spin-collinear calculations with ``nspin=2``, if only one spin component is provided in the file (``nspin_in_file=1``), it will be automatically duplicated for the second spin channel.
- The parameter ``cutoff_cholesky`` can be specified to control the accuracy of Cholesky-related operations (default: ``1e-6``).

The THC representation provides substantial memory and computational savings compared to storing the full four-index ERI tensor, especially for large systems where the number of interpolation points :math:`N_u \ll M^2` (where :math:`M` is the number of orbitals).

Final Notes on Hamiltonians
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The code CoQuí is able to generate and output both the K-Point Factorized, and THC Hamiltonian format directly.

Lattice model Hamiltonians can be generated using the afqmctools Python package which is included with SAFIRE. 
See the lattice model tutorials
for more information on how to generate these Hamiltonians.

Finally, if using external tools to generate this file format, 
we provide a sanity checker script in ``utils/bin/test_afqmc_input.py`` 
which will raise errors if the format does not conform to what is being used internally.
